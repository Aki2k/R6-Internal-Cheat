# Rainbow Six internal

My Mediocre Rainbow Six Internal made with ImGui. I use this with my battleye emulator/packet filter for ban packets. If you do not have the same sort of bypass you are going to get gassed.

### Features

My internal isnt anything amazing it only has the basics.

* Spotted Esp
* 2D Boxes (with or without healthbar)
* Display player distance.
* Unlock all
* Glow
* No Recoil/No Spread
